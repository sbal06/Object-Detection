# YOLO Framework Object-Detection
This project aims to use object detection methods such as Sliding Window and YOLO algorithm on real-time video files.

## Notebook/Implementation
### NeuralNetwork.ipynb
- Loads a vehicle dataset from the University of Toronto, creates a simple Neural Network to predict class images.

### SlidingWindow.ipynb
- Implementation of the sliding window approach throughout the entire image. The car and truck images were trained from the vehicle dataset (trained using a chosen CNN and VGG16 model). Then, each crop of the image was responsible if it's a car, truck, or background. Achieved a 73.33% accuracy.
